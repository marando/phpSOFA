   *
   *  Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2000
   *  resolutions but using the truncated nutation model IAU 2000B).
   *
   *  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
   *  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
   *
   *  Status:  support function.
   *
   *  Given:
   *     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
   *
   *  Returned (function value):
   *                double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
   *
   *  Notes:
   *
   *  1) The UT1 date uta+utb is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   *     convenient way between the argument pair.  For example,
   *     JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
   *     others:
   *
   *             uta            utb
   *
   *         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
   *         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
   *         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
   *         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
   *
   *     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
   *     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
   *     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
   *     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
   *     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
   *     Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
   *     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
   *     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
   *     versa.
   *
   *  2) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions, except
   *     that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of speed and
   *     convenience in two respects:
   *
   *     . UT is used instead of TDB (or TT) to compute the precession
   *       component of GMST and the equation of the equinoxes.  This
   *       results in errors of order 0.1 mas at present.
   *
   *     . The IAU 2000B abridged nutation model (McCarthy & Luzum, 2001)
   *       is used, introducing errors of up to 1 mas.
   *
   *  3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
   *     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible
   *     components such as precession-nutation.
   *
   *  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
   *
   *  5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS
   *     Conventions 2003.
   *
   *  Called:
   *     iauGmst00    Greenwich mean sidereal time, IAU 2000
   *     iauEe00b     equation of the equinoxes, IAU 2000B
